This is a continuation from the first link:https://raghakot.github.io/2017/01/03/Exploring-alternative-neural-computational-models.html[post] on exporing alternative neural computational models.

To recap quickly, a neuron is fundamentally acting as a pattern matching unit by computing the dot product \(W \cdot X\), which is equivalent to un-normalized cosine similarity between vectors \(W\) and \(X\). This raises an obvious question.

> What if the neuron computes alternative similarity metrics?

The remainder of this post is set out to explore this question.

== Similarity metric candidates

Consider the following weight vector template corresponding to vertical edge pattern `|`:

\(W = \begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 1.0 & 0.2\\ 
1.0 & 1.0 & 1.0\\
0.2 & 1.0 & 0.2 
\end{bmatrix} \)

When a neuron tries to match this pattern in a \(3 \times 3\) input image patch, it will only output a high value if a vertical edge is found in the center of the image patch. i.e., dot product is not invariant to shifts. My first thought was to use link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient[pearson coefficient] as it provides shift invariance. However, this not a problem in practice as the filter is slid across all possible \(3 \times 3\) patches within the input image.

In a way, the sliding window operation is quite clever as it communicates information about _parts of the image_ matching filter template without increasing the number of _trainable_ parameters.

How about rotational invariance? We know that a lot of conv filters are identical, rotated by some non-random factor.
