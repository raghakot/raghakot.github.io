:hp-tags: deep learning

This is a continuation from the first link:https://raghakot.github.io/2017/01/03/Exploring-alternative-neural-computational-models.html[post] on exporing alternative neural computational models.

To recap quickly, a neuron is fundamentally acting as a pattern matching unit by computing the dot product \(W \cdot X\), which is equivalent to un-normalized cosine similarity between vectors \(W\) and \(X\). This raises an obvious question.

> What if the neuron computes alternative similarity metrics?

The remainder of this post is set out to explore this question.

== Similarity metric candidates

Consider the following weight vector template corresponding to vertical edge pattern `|`:

\(W = \begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 1.0 & 0.2\\ 
1.0 & 1.0 & 1.0\\
0.2 & 1.0 & 0.2 
\end{bmatrix} \)

When a neuron tries to match this pattern in a \(3 \times 3\) input image patch, it will only output a high value if a vertical edge is found in the center of the image patch. This is however not a problem in practice as the filter is slid across all possible \(3 \times 3\) patches within the input image as depicted in the figure below.
