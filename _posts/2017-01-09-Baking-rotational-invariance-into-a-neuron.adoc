This is a continuation from the first link:https://raghakot.github.io/2017/01/03/Exploring-alternative-neural-computational-models.html[post] on exploring alternative neural computational models. To recap quickly, a neuron is fundamentally acting as a pattern matching unit by computing the dot product \(W \cdot X\), which is equivalent to unnormalized cosine similarity between vectors \(W\) and \(X\).

This model of pattern matching is very naive, in a sense that it is not invariant to translations or rotations. Consider the following weight vector template (conv filter) corresponding to vertical edge pattern `|`

\(W = \begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 1.0 & 0.2\\ 
1.0 & 1.0 & 1.0\\
0.2 & 1.0 & 0.2 
\end{bmatrix} \)

When a neuron tries to match this pattern in a \(3 \times 3\) input image patch, it will only output a high value if a vertical edge is found in the center of the image patch. i.e., dot product is not invariant to shifts. My first thought was to use link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient[Pearson coefficient] as it provides shift invariance. However, this not a problem in practice as the filter is slid across all possible \(3 \times 3\) patches within the input image (see fig2).

In a way, the sliding window operation is quite clever as it communicates information about _parts of the image_ matching filter template without increasing the number of _trainable_ parameters.  As a concrete example, consider a conv-net with filters as shown in fig3footnote:[First layer filters generally detect basic lines and textures, this is just a simplified view to illustrate the point]. The first layer filters (green) detect eyes, nose etc., second layer filters (yellow) detect face, leg etc., by aggregating features from first layer and so onfootnote:[In reality, convolution filters may detect objects that have no meaningful interpretation].

Now suppose the face (represented by two red and one magenta point) is moved to another corner as shown in fig4. The same activations occur, leading to the same end result.

So far so good. How about rotational invariance? We know that a lot of learned conv filters are identical, but rotated by some non-random factor. Instead of learning rotational invariance in this manner, we will try to build it directly into the computational model. The motivation is simple - the neuron should output high value even if some rotated version of pattern is present in the input. Hopefully this eliminates redundant filters and improves test time accuracy.

== Endowing rotational invariance

How can we build rotational invariance into dot product similarity computation? After searching for a bit on the Internet, I couldn't find any obvious similarity metrics that do this. Sure there is link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform[SIFT] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeded_up_robust_features[SURF], but they are complex computations and cannot be expressed in terms of dot products alone.

Instead of trying to come up with a metric, I decided to try the brute force approach of matching the input patch with all possible rotations of the filter. If we take `max` of all those outputs, then, in principle, we are choosing the output resulting from the rotated filter that best `aligns` with the pattern in input patch. This strategy is partly inspired by how conv nets gets around translational invariance problem by simply sliding the filter over all possible locations. Unlike sliding operation, which is an _architectural_ property rather than the computational property of the neuron, the brute force rotations of filters can be confined within the abstraction of neuron, making it a part of the computational model.

Lets look at this idea in more concrete terms. A neuron receives input \(X\) and has associated weights \(W\). Let \(r\) denote some arbitrary discrete rotation \(\theta\). Instead of directly computing \(W \cdot X\), we will compute \(\max \{ rW \cdot X, r^{2}W \cdot X, \cdots, r^{k}W \cdot X \}\), where \(k = \left \lceil \frac{360}{\theta} \right \rceil\) is the number of brute force rotations of \(\theta\) step.

This idea has a number of practical challenges.

* How do we decide \(\theta\)? If we set \(\theta = 90^{\circ}\), we can produce 4 rotated filters.
* For \(\theta \neq 90^{\circ}\) we need interpolation, which might change filter shape.

To avoid interpolation, we can try to shift the image by rotating elements clockwise from outermost layer to innermost layer. For a \(3 \times 3\) image, there are 8 possible rotations. Unfortunately, this only works for filters that are symmetric along the center of the matrix. As an example, consider all 8 rolled rotations of the `L` shaped filter (fig 6). As the image is not symmetric along the center, we get skewed representations for \(45\circ\) rotations. The second image in fig 6 still looks like an `L`, except that the tail end of `L` is squished upwards to maintain \(3 \times 3\) filter shape.

Despite the setback, all \(90^{\circ}\) rotations are accurate and \(45^{\circ}\) rotations are only slightly skewed. Skew might be a blessing in disguise as it might endow the neuron to be _deform_ invariant as well (wishful thinking). In either case, the deformations are not too bad for \(3 \times 3\) filters, and it is at-least worth experimenting with vggnet which uses all \(3 \times 3\) conv filters.

Alternatively, instead of trying all possible alignments, we could try to find \(\theta\) that _maximizes_ the dot product.

Let R denote \(2 \times 2\) rotation matrix.

\(R = \begin{bmatrix}
cos(\theta) & sin(\theta)\\ 
-sin(\theta) & cos(\theta) 
\end{bmatrix}\)

To accomplish optimal alignment, we need \(\theta\) such that:

\(\arg\max_\theta R_{\theta}W \cdot X\)

This can be solved by differentiating with respect to \(\theta\) and equating the derivative to 0.

I finally decided to go with the brute force approach to quickly test out the idea and maybe further develop the math for optimal alignment if it showed promise. The brute-force computations discussed so far apply to an individual neuron. For Convolutional layer, the output is generated as follows:

* Generate all 8 rotated filters from \(W\), \(W_{1}, \cdots, W_{8}\).
* Compute output activation volumesfootnote:[If you are not familiar with the idea of activation volumes, I would recommend referring to link:http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/[CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition] for an outstanding explanation.] \(O_{1}, \cdots, O_{8}\) by convolving input with \(W_{1}, \cdots, W_{8}\).
* Across volumes, select \(x, y\) value corresponding to filter \((row, col)\) that has the max value. This corresponding to selecting the best _aligned_ filter with input patch across the 8 rotations.

These steps can be implemented as follows. Note that `W.shape = (rows, cols, nb_input_filters, nb_output_filters)`. You also need bleeding edge tensorflow from _master_; as of Nov 2016, `gather_nd` does not have a gradient implementation.

def conv2d(x, W, **kwargs):
    w = W
    shape = w.get_shape()

    # Determine all 7 rotations of w.
    w_rot = [w]
    for i in range(7):
        w = tf.reshape(tf.gather_nd(w, permutation), shape)
        w_rot.append(w)

    # Convolve with all 8 rotations and stack.
    outputs = tf.stack([tf.nn.conv2d(x, w_i, **kwargs) for w_i in w_rot])

    # Max filter activation across rotations.
    output = tf.reduce_max(outputs, 0)
    return output

== Discussion

Disappointingly, rotational invariant model resulted in lower val accuracy than the baseline. I had three running hypothesis as to why this might happen.

1. Implementation issue. I ruled this out by testing the `conv2d(...)` implementation by feeding it numpy arrays and verifying the output.
2. Perhaps, rotational invariance is not a good idea for the earlier filters. As an example, consider a latter layer that uses _vertical_ and _horizontal_ edge features for the preceeding layer to detect a _square_ like shape. Having rotational invariance means that it is not possible to distinguish horizontal from vertical edges, making square detection a lot more challenging.
3. Maybe the skew from (\theta = \{45^{\circ}, 135^{\circ}, 225^{\circ}, 315^{\circ}\) was an issue afterall.

To test 2, 3, I decided to run 6 more expeiments by using:

* \(90^{\circ}\) rotations (4 filters) and \(45^{\circ}\) rotations (8 filters)
* Use new conv logic only on all four conv layers (all), last two conv layers (half), and the last conv layer (third).

The results of these expeiments are summarized in fig 8.

It seems evident that using rotationally invariant convolutional layers everywhere is not a good idea (_4pass:[_]rotpass:[_]all_ and _8pass:[_]rotpass:[_]all_ have the lowest values). In accordance with hypothesis 2, the accuracy improved as we get rid of earlier rotationally invariant conv layers, with 4_rot_third and 8_rot_third almost catching up to baseline model accuracy. The skew (according to hypothesis 3) does not seem to the issue as _8pass:[_]rotpass:[_#]_ closely followed _4pass:[_]rotpass:[_#]_ accuracies.
